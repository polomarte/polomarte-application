Feature: Projects registration
  In order to control the projects
  As a visitor
  I want to be able to manage the projects registration

  Scenario: Creating a new valid project
    Given I visit the project new page
    And I should have 0 projects
    When I fill project_name field with "Foobar"
    And click on the "Salvar projeto" button
    Then I should have 1 projects
    And I should see "activerecord.attributes.project.sucess.create"


  Scenario: Creating a new project without a name
    Given I visit the project new page
    When I fill project_name field with ""
    And click on the "Salvar projeto" button
    Then I should have 0 projects
    And I should see "errors.messages.empty"

  Scenario: Editing a existent project
    Given I have projects named School
    And I should have 1 projects
    And I visit the School edit page
    When I fill project_name field with "Edited School Project"
    And click on the "Salvar projeto" button
    Then I should have 1 projects
    And I should see "activerecord.attributes.project.sucess.update"
    And I should see "tests.messages.school"
